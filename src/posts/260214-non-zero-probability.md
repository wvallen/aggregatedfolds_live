I sat on my deck and played Holst’s *Jupiter* toward the sky. The tuba pushed columns of air into motion; pressure waves radiated outward, coupling molecule to molecule and diffusing into turbulence and thermal noise within a few hundred meters. Sound belongs to atmosphere. Its energy disperses as it spreads. By the time it reaches the treeline, it is already folding back into quiet.

Jupiter hung above that treeline as a bright point. With my binoculars, four faint companions—its moons—resolved beside it, small beads shifting position according to orbital mechanics. The light in that glint began as fusion in the Sun, photons born in a stellar core, random-walking outward for thousands of years before escaping into space. Once free of the Sun’s surface, their pace became fixed by the speed of light, about eight minutes per astronomical unit. The path from Sun to Jupiter spans roughly five astronomical units, and from Jupiter to Earth another four to six, depending on orbital alignment. From the moment those photons left the solar surface to the moment they entered my pupils, the free-flight portion of their journey lasted on the order of eighty to ninety minutes.

As electromagnetic radiation propagates, its intensity decreases with distance according to the inverse square law,

I ∝ 1 / r²,

because fixed energy distributes across expanding area. The flux reaching Earth depended on the instantaneous separation between two moving planets. The fraction reaching my retina depended on atmospheric clarity, pupil diameter, and the precise angle between my line of sight and Jupiter’s coordinates at that second.

At that spacetime coordinate—latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp—photons entered my pupils. Each photon triggered a conformational change in an opsin molecule. That molecular event altered membrane potentials and initiated signals that traveled through retinal layers, along the optic nerve, and into cortex. Neuronal circuitry integrated these discrete arrivals into a coherent percept: a bright point accompanied by four companions. From a sparse stream of quanta, my brain constructed a planet.

The percept felt immediate. The geometry behind it spanned astronomical scale.

I found myself thinking about the path of those photons, about the arc from stellar fusion to molecular transduction, about the alignment required for light emitted minutes earlier and billions of kilometers away to intersect a few square millimeters of retinal tissue at precisely this second. The likelihood that any given photon reflected from Jupiter would encounter my pupils at that moment is extremely small. Vision depends on the fact that some do.

Sound cannot traverse interplanetary space; pressure waves require a medium. So I reached for light instead. I lifted my headlamp and flashed a single Morse character toward Jupiter—W: dot dash dash—three pulses entering darkness.

The lamp emitted photons within a forward cone shaped by reflector geometry. As the beam propagated outward, its energy per unit area diminished under the same inverse square relation governing the reflected sunlight I had just received. At Jupiter’s orbital distance, the illuminated cross-sectional area had expanded enormously. Jupiter occupies a minute solid angle when viewed from Earth. The fraction of emitted photons whose trajectories intersect the planet is correspondingly small.

The probability is non-zero.

In quantum mechanics, interaction between systems is described by a wavefunction whose squared magnitude gives the likelihood of a specific outcome:

P = |ψ|².

An event requires overlap in space and time. As long as amplitude retains support at the relevant coordinates, interaction remains allowed. For a photon from my lamp to encounter Jupiter’s atmosphere, the numerical value of P is extremely small. The mathematical structure preserves it.

Some interpretations treat every permitted outcome as embedded within a branching structure of histories. Branches differ in weight. Each corresponds to a consistent unfolding of events.

Within that structure exists a history in which one photon carrying my signal reaches Jupiter’s clouds.

If awareness traces one such history, then experience becomes a path through weighted possibilities. Most histories contain dispersal into interplanetary space. A slender subset contains arrival, a faint inscription of my deck and my instrument carried outward on a beam of light.

In that history, Jupiter and I exchange signals.

Light leaves the Sun, reflects from Jupiter, enters my retina, and triggers neuronal circuitry. Light leaves my lamp, expands across space, and touches Jupiter’s atmosphere. Fusion, reflection, perception, intention, emission—an arc spanning stellar core to cortical firing.

Valentine becomes reciprocity.

At this coordinate in spacetime, I received photons that departed Jupiter less than an hour and a half earlier. I responded with photons of my own. Geometry, chemistry, biology, and choice converged in a single moment. The odds of this exact configuration—this observer, this instrument, this planet overhead—are small in any combinatorial sense. Their realization is the condition of experience.

Non-zero probability grants permission.

This moment was permitted.

I remained there for several minutes, brass warm in my hands, Jupiter steady above the trees, aware that the exchange might be immeasurably faint and still fully real within the mathematics that describes it.

So I align myself with the history in which my name in light reaches Jupiter.
