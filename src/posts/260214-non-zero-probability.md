I played Holst’s <em>Jupiter</em> while Jupiter held its place above the trees.

The tuba sent pressure waves into cold air. They marched through nearby molecules, spent their energy as heat, and folded back into quiet. Sound needs a medium. It lives close to where it is made.

Light does not.

The light reaching my eyes from Jupiter left its cloud tops tens of minutes earlier. It arrives as an electromagnetic field propagating at

<div class="eq">
  c = 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s
</div>

and it does what waves do when nothing stops them: it expands.

A flash, a glint, a steady glow from a planet becomes a growing sphere centered on its source. At radius <span class="eqi">r</span>, that sphere carries its power across a surface area

<div class="eq">
  A(r) = 4π r<sup>2</sup>
</div>

so the intensity thins with distance,

<div class="eq">
  I(r) ∝ 1 / r<sup>2</sup>.
</div>

This is not pixelated. It is geometry doing its simple work.

If I isolate emission over a brief interval <span class="eqi">Δt</span>, that portion of the field occupies a shell of thickness

<div class="eq">
  Δr = c Δt.
</div>

Compared with astronomical radius, the shell is a razor edge, still moving, still real. My pupil intercepts only a tiny patch of the sphere. The retina integrates the incoming field over tens of milliseconds. Billions of oscillations pass through that window. Charges shift. Currents rise. A scene appears.

Perception is what integration feels like from the inside.

After lowering the instrument, I lifted my headlamp toward Jupiter. The lamp emitted its own outward sphere under the same equations. At Jupiter’s orbit, the surface area of that sphere is immense. The fraction that could intersect the planet is absurdly small.

Absurdly small is non-zero.

Quantum mechanics gives that sentence teeth. The world is described by amplitude, and amplitude carries probability. A compact signature is

<div class="eq">
  P = |ψ|<sup>2</sup>,
</div>

but the deeper point is quieter: wherever the wavefunction has support, the possibility of interaction persists. A photon leaving a small source on Earth may miss everything for a long time, yet the formalism still permits a meeting across astronomical distance.

A planet does not need to be likely. It only needs to be allowed.

Gravity shares the same mood. Influence weakens with distance, yet it keeps shaping motion. A tiny perturbation applied repeatedly changes an orbit over time. Per revolution, the deviation hides. Over many revolutions, the system reorients. The cumulative drift becomes a new path.

Neural systems live in that same arithmetic. Synaptic inputs arrive as pulses. Membrane potentials integrate across time. Repeated signals redistribute likelihood across a network. Patterns stabilize. Preference forms. Identity condenses, not as a single event, but as the long sum of small fields.

Under this lens, experience becomes intersection with expanding waves.

Attention is integration.

A life is shaped by countless contributions, some loud, some faint, each spreading outward, each touching structure, each carrying weight proportional to its amplitude.

Standing beneath Jupiter, playing toward it, I participated in that exchange. Sound remained near. Light traveled outward. Light traveled inward. Fields expanded through space, thinning with distance, persisting as geometry.

The equations allow vanishingly small values.

They carry them forward anyway.
