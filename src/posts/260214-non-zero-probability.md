*On love, signal, and probability*

I played Holst’s *Jupiter* while Jupiter held its place above the trees.

The tuba sent pressure waves into cold air. Those waves leaned on nearby molecules, then thinned out fast. Sound asks for a medium. It stays local.

Light behaves differently.

The light reaching my eyes from Jupiter left its cloud tops tens of minutes earlier. It rides at a speed that stays steady:

c = 3 × 10^8  m/s

Think of emission as a wavefront expanding outward. At any instant, energy occupies a huge sphere centered on its source. As the radius grows, the surface area grows too:

<figure>
<pre style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.35; padding: 0.75rem 1rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15); border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
A = 4π r^2
</pre>

Equation 2. A sphere’s surface area, where the same energy must spread as distance grows.

</figure>

So the intensity at distance *r* falls with the familiar inverse-square:

<figure>
<pre style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.35; padding: 0.75rem 1rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15); border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
I ∝ 1 / r^2
</pre>
<figcaption>
Equation 3. Dilution with distance. Spreading, attenuation, persistence.

</figure>

The “shell” picture helps here.

Pick a tiny time window, Δt. During that interval, the wavefront advances by a thickness cΔt. Compared with the Jupiter-scale radius, the thickness looks vanishingly thin, like a skin sliding through space. If Δt shrinks, the skin shrinks with it, and the picture approaches a continuous flow. A stream of thin shells, stacked so densely that the stack becomes a field.

My pupil catches a small patch of one of those shells. My retina integrates incoming light over tens of milliseconds. In that window, the electromagnetic field oscillates billions of times. Perception comes from integration: time turns waves into signal.

After I lowered the instrument, I lifted my headlamp toward Jupiter.

Same geometry. Same spreading. Same inverse-square dilution. By the time the headlamp’s wavefront reaches Jupiter’s orbit, the sphere is enormous. The fraction intersecting Jupiter’s disk becomes absurdly small.

Absurdly small still carries a value.

In quantum mechanics, we keep track of that idea with amplitude:

<figure>
<pre style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 0.95rem; line-height: 1.35; padding: 0.75rem 1rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15); border-radius: 8px; overflow-x: auto;">
P = |ψ|^2
</pre>

Equation 4. Probability from amplitude. Geometry spreads the wave thin; it still occupies space.
</figcaption>
</figure>

That is the hinge I keep coming back to. Distance makes signals faint. Time makes them delayed. Physics keeps carrying them forward anyway.

Gravity feels like a cousin to this. It weakens with distance, yet it keeps bending trajectories. A small perturbation applied once barely registers. Applied repeatedly, it becomes a new orbit.

Brains behave the same way. Synaptic inputs arrive, integrate, accumulate. Tiny pushes add up. Patterns stabilize. Identity forms through exposure to fields of influence, sustained over time.

So the night becomes one exchange:

Sound out into the near air.  
Light in from a far world.  
Light out from a small lamp.  
Wavefronts expanding, thinning, arriving.  
A life, shaped the same way.
