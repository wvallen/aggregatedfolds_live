I played Holst’s *Jupiter* while Jupiter held its place above the trees.

The tuba sent pressure waves into cold air. Those waves moved through nearby molecules and dissipated quickly. Sound requires a medium. It remains local.

Light does not.

The light reaching my eyes from Jupiter left its cloud tops tens of minutes earlier. It travels at

<br>

\[
c = 3 \times 10^8 \ \text{m/s}
\]

<br>

as a continuously expanding spherical wave. At any given moment, the electromagnetic field occupies an immense sphere centered on its source. As that sphere grows, the same energy distributes across an ever-increasing surface area,

<br>

\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]

<br>

and the intensity scales accordingly,

<br>

\[
I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\]

<br>

Nothing about this expansion is discrete. The field propagates smoothly. If we isolate emission over a brief interval of time \( \Delta t \), that portion of the field occupies a shell of thickness \( c\,\Delta t \). Compared with the astronomical radius of the sphere, that thickness becomes negligible.

My pupil intercepts only a minute patch of that expanding surface. The retina integrates the incoming field over tens of milliseconds. Billions of oscillations pass during that window. Electrical signals accumulate. Perception emerges from temporal integration of a continuous wave.

After lowering the instrument, I lifted my headlamp toward Jupiter. The light leaving the lamp propagated outward under the same equations. Its field expanded as a sphere centered on me. At the orbit of Jupiter, the surface area of that sphere is vast. The fraction intersecting the planet becomes extraordinarily small.

Extraordinarily small is non-zero.

Quantum mechanics expresses this through probability amplitude,

<br>

\[
P = |\psi|^2
\]

<br>

Where amplitude exists, probability exists. The magnitude may approach practical insignificance while remaining present in the formal description. A photon emitted from a small source on Earth carries non-zero probability of interacting with matter across astronomical distance.

Gravity follows similar mathematics. Gravitational influence weakens with distance and continues to curve motion. A slight perturbation applied repeatedly alters an orbit over time. The deviation per revolution may appear negligible. Integrated across many revolutions, the system acquires a new orientation.

Neural systems operate through accumulation as well. Synaptic inputs arrive as electrical pulses. Membrane potentials integrate across space and time. Repeated signals redistribute probability across networks. Patterns stabilize. Identity forms through continuous exposure to fields of influence.

Under this lens, experience becomes intersection with expanding waves. Attention is integration across time. A life is shaped by countless small contributions — some intense, some faint — each spreading outward, each intersecting structure, each carrying weight proportional to its amplitude.

Standing beneath Jupiter, playing toward it, I participated in that exchange. Sound remained near. Light traveled outward. Light traveled inward. Fields expanded through space, thinning with distance and persisting within geometry.

The equations allow vanishingly small values. They continue to carry them forward.
