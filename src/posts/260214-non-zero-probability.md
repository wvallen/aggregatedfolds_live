I played Holst’s *Jupiter* while Jupiter occupied a precise position above the trees—a location determined by celestial mechanics and by my own coordinates on Earth: latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.

The light entering my pupils began as solar radiation scattered from Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. Those photons traveled from the Sun to Jupiter and then across roughly five astronomical units to intersect a rotating planet called Earth at a particular second in February 2026. Their trajectories and mine met at a shared spacetime coordinate.

As electromagnetic radiation propagates, its intensity decreases with distance according to the inverse square law,

I ∝ 1 / r²,

because fixed energy distributes across expanding area. The flux at my position depended on the separation between two planets at that moment. The fraction intercepted depended on the area of my pupils and the transparency of the atmosphere between us.

Each photon that reached me triggered a conformational change in an opsin molecule. That molecular event altered membrane potential, initiating electrical signals that propagated through retinal circuits into cortex. The result was simple: a bright point suspended in darkness, accompanied by several faint companions barely distinguishable from background stars. That minimal signal was enough to register presence.

In January 1610, Galileo Galilei observed those faint companions shifting position night after night. The points of light revealed structure—moons orbiting Jupiter rather than Earth. A modest optical instrument, combined with careful repetition, altered cosmology. A small signal, integrated across evenings, reorganized understanding.

My own observation carried no revolution. It carried alignment.

After lowering the instrument, I raised my headlamp and directed its beam toward Jupiter’s coordinates.

The lamp emitted photons confined within a forward cone shaped by its reflector. As the beam propagated outward, its energy per unit area diminished under the same geometric law that governed the reflected sunlight. At Jupiter’s orbital distance, the illuminated cross-sectional area had expanded enormously. The solid angle subtended by Jupiter from Earth is minute. The overlap between beam and planet is correspondingly small.

Small here can be estimated. The fraction of emitted photons capable of intersecting Jupiter’s atmosphere approaches zero as distance increases. Approaches, but does not reach.

In quantum mechanics, interaction between systems is described by a wavefunction whose squared magnitude gives the likelihood of a specific outcome:

P = |ψ|².

An event requires overlap in space and time. As long as amplitude retains support at those coordinates, interaction remains allowed. The numerical value of P for a photon from my lamp striking Jupiter’s clouds is extraordinarily low. The formalism preserves it.

Some interpretations of quantum theory treat every permitted outcome as embedded within a larger branching structure. Outcomes differ in measure. All remain present in the mathematical object.

Within that structure exists a branch in which one photon from my lamp encountered Jupiter’s atmosphere.

The dominant branch contains dispersal into interplanetary space. A smaller branch contains arrival. Both are solutions to the same equations.

The more improbable alignment lies closer to home.

For this moment to occur, stellar nucleosynthesis had to generate heavy elements. Planetary accretion had to assemble Earth. Chemistry had to produce replicating molecules. Evolution had to generate nervous systems capable of integrating light into perception. Countless contingencies had to unfold across billions of years. The probability of this specific configuration—this observer, at these coordinates, receiving these photons—is vanishingly small in any naive combinatorial sense.

And yet here it is.

A photon reflected from Jupiter intersected retinal tissue. A neural circuit stabilized a point of light. A body chose to lift a lamp and send photons outward in return.

The arc from Sun to Jupiter to retina to cortex to gesture spans astronomical distance and molecular scale. It spans cosmology and chemistry. It spans history and choice.

Non-zero probability does not imply likely. It implies permitted.

This moment, too, was permitted.

That fact alone renders it singular.
