I played Holst’s *Jupiter* while Jupiter occupied a precise position in the sky above the trees—an alignment defined by celestial mechanics and by my own coordinates on Earth: latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.

The light entering my eyes began as solar radiation scattered from hydrogen, helium, and layered clouds in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Those photons traveled from the Sun to Jupiter, then across roughly five astronomical units of interplanetary space to intersect a moving planet called Earth, and finally a body standing on its surface at a specific second in February 2026. The encounter between planet and retina occurred at a spacetime coordinate shared by both trajectories.

As electromagnetic radiation propagates, its intensity decreases with distance according to the inverse square law,

I ∝ 1 / r²,

because fixed energy distributes across an expanding surface area. Geometry governs the dilution. The distance from Jupiter to Earth defines the flux at that location. The area of my pupils defines the fraction intercepted.

Each photon that reached me triggered a conformational change in an opsin molecule. That molecular transition altered membrane potential in a rod or cone cell. Electrical signals propagated through bipolar and ganglion cells, along the optic nerve, into cortical circuits that integrate activity across milliseconds. A disk stabilized. Bands of color resolved. Four faint points—Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto—occupied positions consistent with orbital mechanics.

In January 1610, Galileo Galilei observed those same moons through a small refracting telescope. Night after night, he recorded their changing positions relative to Jupiter. The conclusion was structural: orbital motion could occur around bodies other than Earth. A local observation forced a reconfiguration of cosmology. Perception, when repeated and integrated, reorganizes belief.

Every planetary sighting is a convergence of trajectories: solar photons, planetary reflection, terrestrial rotation, neural computation. The planet appears when geometry and biology align.

After lowering the instrument, I lifted my headlamp and directed its beam toward Jupiter’s coordinates.

The lamp emitted photons confined within a forward cone determined by reflector shape and filament placement. As the beam propagated outward, its energy per unit area decreased with distance under the same geometric law. At Jupiter’s orbital radius, the illuminated cross-sectional area had expanded enormously relative to its origin. The solid angle subtended by Jupiter at that distance is minute. The overlap between beam and planet is correspondingly small.

Small in this context is calculable.

In quantum mechanics, interaction between systems is described by a wavefunction whose squared magnitude gives the likelihood of a particular outcome:

P = |ψ|².

An interaction event—one photon from my lamp intersecting Jupiter’s atmosphere—requires spatial and temporal overlap of amplitudes. The overlap exists as long as the wavefunction retains support across those coordinates. The associated probability may be extremely low. The mathematical structure retains it.

Certain interpretations of quantum theory treat the full wavefunction as physically real. In that framework, all outcomes consistent with the governing equations persist as branches within a larger state. Branches differ in weight. None are removed from the formal object.

A photon reaching Jupiter corresponds to a branch with very small measure. The geometry allows the intersection. The amplitude assigns it weight.

If consciousness follows a single path through this branching structure, then experience traces one history among many permitted by the equations. Most histories contain dispersal of photons into interplanetary space. A smaller subset contains arrival.

On this evening, at these coordinates, I orient my awareness toward that subset.

Sound from the tuba remained bound to local air, dissipating within fields and tree lines. Reflected sunlight crossed astronomical distance and entered my retina. A beam from Earth extended outward toward a gas giant orbiting beyond Mars.

Within the total structure of possibility, there exists a history in which one of those photons encountered Jupiter’s clouds.

The equations carry that history as part of the whole.

A life is shaped in similar fashion. Countless interactions possess low individual weight. Repetition accumulates measure. Small overlaps alter trajectories. Neural pathways strengthen through repeated coincidence of activity. Identity emerges from the integration of events whose probabilities may once have seemed negligible.

Physics does not discard small terms.

It integrates them.
