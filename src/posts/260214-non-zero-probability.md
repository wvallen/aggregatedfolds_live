I sat on my deck and played Holst’s *Jupiter* toward the sky. The tuba pushed columns of air into motion; pressure waves radiated outward, coupling molecule to molecule, diffusing into turbulence and thermal noise within a few hundred meters. Sound belongs to atmosphere. It decays as it spreads. By the time it reaches the treeline, it is already folding back into quiet.

Jupiter hung above that treeline as a bright point. With my binoculars, I can make out four faint companions—its moons—hovered nearby, barely separable from the star field. No storms, no disk, only a concentrated glint. The light in that glint began as fusion in the Sun, photons born in a stellar core, random-walking outward for thousands of years before escaping into space. Those photons traveled roughly 5 astronomical units to reach Jupiter, scattered from hydrogen and ammonia clouds, and then crossed another 5 astronomical units to intersect Earth.

As electromagnetic radiation propagates, its intensity decreases with distance according to the inverse square law,

I ∝ 1 / r²,

because fixed energy distributes across expanding area. The flux reaching Earth depended on the instantaneous separation between two moving planets. The fraction reaching me depended on atmospheric transparency, pupil diameter, and the exact angle between my line of sight and Jupiter’s coordinates at that second.

At that spacetime coordinate—latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp—photons entered my pupils. Each photon triggered a conformational change in an opsin molecule. That molecular shift altered membrane potentials, initiating signals that traveled through retinal layers, along the optic nerve, into cortex. Neuronal circuitry integrated these discrete arrivals into a stable percept: a bright point with faint companions. My brain assembled a planet from a sparse stream of quanta.

The event felt simple. The geometry behind it was not.

I sat there thinking about the path of those photons, about the arc from stellar fusion to retinal transduction, about the fact that my awareness depended on trajectories aligning across billions of kilometers and fractions of a second. The chances that any given photon from Jupiter would intersect the area defined by my pupils at that exact moment were extraordinarily small. The fact that some did is the condition of sight.

Sound would never carry my tuba to Jupiter. Pressure waves require a medium; interplanetary space offers vacuum. So I reached for light instead. I lifted my headlamp and flashed a single Morse character toward Jupiter—W: dot dash dash—three pulses cut into darkness.

The lamp emitted photons within a forward cone shaped by reflector geometry. As the beam propagated outward, its power per unit area decreased under the same inverse square relation that governed the reflected sunlight I had just received. At Jupiter’s orbital distance, the illuminated cross-section expanded enormously. The solid angle subtended by Jupiter from Earth is minute. The fraction of emitted photons whose trajectories intersect the planet is correspondingly tiny.

The probability is non-zero.

In quantum mechanics, interaction between systems is described by a wavefunction whose squared magnitude gives the likelihood of a particular outcome:

P = |ψ|².

An interaction requires overlap in space and time. As long as amplitude retains support at those coordinates, the event remains allowed. For a photon from my lamp to encounter Jupiter’s atmosphere, the numerical value of P is extremely small. The formalism keeps it alive.

Certain interpretations of quantum theory treat the full wavefunction as real, with all permitted outcomes embedded within a branching structure. Branches differ in measure. Each corresponds to a consistent history of events.

Within that structure exists a branch in which one photon carrying my signal reaches Jupiter’s clouds.

If consciousness traces one branch through that landscape of possibility, then awareness rides a path defined by amplitude. Most paths contain dispersal into interplanetary space. A slender path contains arrival—a faint signature of my deck, my tuba, my coordinates, inscribed in scattered sunlight on a gas giant.

In that branch, Jupiter and I exchange signals.

Light leaves the Sun, reflects from Jupiter, enters my retina, triggers neuronal circuitry. Light leaves my lamp, expands across space, and touches Jupiter’s atmosphere. A loop forms across astronomical distance: fusion, reflection, perception, intention, emission.

Valentine is a mirror.

At this coordinate in spacetime, I received photons that left Jupiter minutes earlier. I responded with photons of my own. The alignment required geometry, chemistry, biology, and choice. The numerical odds of this exact configuration—this body, this instrument, this planet overhead—are small in any combinatorial accounting. Their occurrence is the condition of experience.

Non-zero probability does not promise repetition. It grants permission.

This moment was permitted.

I sat with it, holding a brass instrument warm from breath, watching a planet burn steady against black, thinking about light and time and the improbability of awareness. The exchange may be vanishingly faint. The equations allow it. The branch contains it.

So I choose the branch where my name in light reaches Jupiter.
