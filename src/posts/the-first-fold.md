      <h1>Folding</h1>
      <p><em>Not a thesis. A trajectory.<br>Not a conclusion. A coalescence.<br>Not perfect. Not final.<br>Just ready.</em></p>

    <p>This blog didn’t begin with a plan.</p>
    <p>It began with potential—thoughts suspended in solution, fragments of memory, molecular metaphors, half-finished ideas. They floated there for years. Some came from textbooks, some from field notes, some from long walks and long silences. I didn’t know what they would become. But like proteins under the right conditions, they began to fold.</p>

    <p>Each post here is a structure formed from contact—less a statement, more a stabilization. The way a peptide finds shape through molecular interactions, these essays and fragments find form through friction with the world. Lessons learned in the lab bind to moments of joy, confusion, failure, awe. Textbook diagrams collapse into metaphor. Concepts once sharp with scientific precision soften under lived experience. And in the right configuration, they hold.</p>

    <p>I’ve always had ideas.</p>
    <p>Not always the words.</p>

    <p>Long-form writing often eluded me. I thought in shape, in movement, in synthesis—ideas came fast, recursive, relational—but I couldn’t always slow them into prose. Now, with tools newly available to me, I can. This blog is not a performance of authorship. It’s a <strong>curated emergence</strong>. A folding. These aren’t handwritten entries, but they’re not impersonal either. They’re me—finally visible.</p>

    <p>I use a generative engine not as a ghostwriter, but as a kind of scaffold. A shelf. I bring my fragments—my questions, metaphors, data points, memories—to its surface, and together we shape. I’m not typing to express ideas; I’m selecting, refining, letting the structure emerge. It’s recursive. It’s rhythmic. It’s what I’ve always done in my head—only now, there’s a form to hold it.</p>

    <p>What you’re reading is the result of aggregation.</p>
    <p>Experience, intuition, and science converging.</p>
    <p>Stabilized into form.</p>

    <p>A protein’s shape is determined by its interactions—its charges, its edges, its environment. A post is no different. Each one here is influenced by forces not always visible. Questions I’ve asked myself. Failures I’ve metabolized. The quiet pull of something I don’t yet understand. Surface tension guides the fold. The blog is the visible interface—what remains when enough pressure and meaning gather to become structure.</p>

    <p>So if you’re reading this, welcome.</p>
    <p>Wander freely. Stay if it resonates. Let it seed something in you.</p>
    <p>Let it drift across your neural folds and settle—not because it’s correct, but because it found a surface in you to cling to, however briefly.</p>

    <p>This is <em>Folding</em>.</p>
