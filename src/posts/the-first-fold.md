Every untaken photograph is both lost and eternal—  
a Schrödinger’s moment suspended in possibility.

This blog is not a catalog.  
It is a field of resonances.  
Here, the folds do not contain; they reveal.  
The sharp edge of memory against the soft skin of becoming.  
Fragments, loose and luminous.
