**_Everything is a chemical reaction. Sometimes the product is a melody._**  
*A long July night, layered with light, sound, and the oldest choreography of matter announcing: I’m here.*

The night unfolds slowly, but its energy began before memory. On the Fourth of July, we light the fuse. We burn things in rhythm. Across the Midwest, fireworks bloom and echo—more than celebration, they’re tradition, ritualized combustion. Each explosion is a message: of community, of place, of continuity. Engineered bursts ripple across the landscape, releasing pressure and light not just into the sky, but into history.

The chemistry is simple, but not simplistic. Oxidizers meet fuels in just the right proportions. The oxidizer—potassium nitrate—releases oxygen as it breaks down, feeding a sugar like sucrose (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁). Add fine iron powder, and you get both heat and sparks: tiny particles incandesce in midair. It looks like magic. It’s really stoichiometry.

2 KNO₃ + C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + Fe + heat → Fe₂O₃ + 12 CO₂ + 11 H₂O + light + heat

That’s the math of a sparkler. A long, slow burn engineered to hold the eye. Chemistry in a tightrope walk between combustion and containment. When I lit one beside my shipping container cabin— bare, raw, resting in its new spot among the tall grass—it flared like a tiny handheld star. The sparks curved outward. Some embedded into the air with long arcs, others vanished instantly. Each one a hot shout of iron releasing light. I held it loosely, the way I was taught. Not too tight. Not angled wrong. And I started to write.

At the campground as a kid, we all did it— waving our names in the night. I remember watching adults sit back in lawn chairs, beers in hand, watching us with easy trust. For a moment we were initiates of combustion. We traced spirals and comets and hearts. I always wrote a **W**. My advantage: palindromic. Symmetrical in both directions. I didn’t have to think about writing it backward in space to make it appear forward in light-trace. I just let it happen. The W shimmered for a second, already gone. But I knew it had been there. That moment of creation was enough.

The sparkler hissed toward its final inch. The fuse glowed, then vanished. The light was gone, but the night continued. Far off, other families were still lighting fireworks—muffled thuds echoing through the prairie, no color, just low pressure bursts into the air. Behind it all, the moon watched. Fireflies began appearing again, their own chemistry more restrained. **Luciferase enzymes in their abdomens** released light in silent pulses. No combustion, no heat—just cool bioluminescence, operating in tandem with oxygen and ATP. They wrote their own invisible code.

I sat near the pond. Not insulated from the world, but nestled in it. The container’s steel walls radiated back the heat of the day, now cooled in the evening breeze. I listened. No frogs yet. Just the echo of explosions, fading. One by one, they quieted. Distant farms stopped sending their sonic declarations. And then, almost imperceptibly, a new wave began.

Frogs.

At first it was scattered. Disordered. Chirps in no clear pattern. But then the calls started to align. Timing adjusted. Spacing evened. A chorus emerged—not harmonic, but **rhythmic**, like sequenced pulses in a neural network. Wet circuitry making sound. Like us, they were **announcing presence**. Not with names, but with oscillations. Biological LC circuits tuned to dusk.

I brought out my tuba. Brass, weighty and tuned by hand. My own synthetic resonator. I didn’t want to overpower them. I just wanted to join. First, I played low notes, held steady. The frogs paused. Some shifted. Others waited. Then I changed— moved into melody. Minor chords. Riffs with space between them. A conversation, not a command. It was no longer mimicry. It was a duet. Their alignment shifted to accommodate mine. My breath moved through a tube of metal to become vibration, then pressure, then sound. Just as theirs did. Just with more layers. More gates for the energy to pass through.

The frogs adjusted again. Not silence, not noise, but a modulation. They seemed to hear me. Seemed to **respond**. This wasn’t random chirping—it was phase, entrainment, **resonance**. My low notes were still my own, but they carried more. Not just pressure waves but **intentionality**. Emotion. Memory. Identity. I played phrases I’d never played before. As if my whole body wanted to sing, not just the mouth or the lungs. The whole thing—hands, brain, posture—working together to release an internal potential. Not unlike the sparkler.

Everything is a chemical reaction. The frogs. The fireflies. The brass and my lungs. It’s all just different levels of the same cascade: energy pushing through matter, shaped by context and structure. Each added layer of complexity becomes a new chance to say something. A new modulation of light, or sound, or being.

And that night, in the long arc from explosion to echo, we all said it together.

**I’m here. I can respond. I can resonate.**  
That’s what identity really is. A signal with memory.  
And I learned I could sing with frogs.  
Not because I had to.  
But because I understood what they were saying.
